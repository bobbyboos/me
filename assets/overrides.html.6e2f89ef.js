The extension includes a built-in wizard for creating these files. You can then save them for later or share them with another user.</p><p>When a user imports an override file, the preferences stored in the file <strong>override</strong> any pre-existing Beta Protection preferences. What&#39;s more, once active an override file cannot be disabled without knowing the key for the file (and optionally after a time delay). Until its disabled, Beta Protection will use the preferences from the override file and ignore/prevent any conflicting preference changes.</p><p>If you have the key, you can enter it and disable the override file, at which point Beta Protection will use your regular preferences again.</p><h2 id="usage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Usage</h2><p>Most things involving overrides are handled from the dedicated Overrides page.

In brief, you will configure the censoring preferences you want to include, optionally add any other settings, set which modes are allowed then set the unlock requirements. Once it&#39;s done, you can export your new override file which will be saved as a <code>.betaoverride</code> file.</p><blockquote><p>You can use the minimum duration combined with limiting censoring modes to make an effective override for yourself as well!</p></blockquote><h4 id="create-an-override-from-an-existing-file" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#create-an-override-from-an-existing-file" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Create an override from an existing file</h4><p>If you already have an override file, either your own or someone else&#39;s, you can create a new override based on that file. Switch to the <em>Create From Existing</em> tab at the top of the page and import the override file you want to start with. You can then follow the wizard just like usual to create a new override, but the settings in the wizard will be pre-filled based on the override file you imported.</p><p>The new override will be a new file with its own key, and will not affect the imported override at all.</p><h3 id="importing-an-override-file" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#importing-an-override-file" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Importing an override file</h3><p>Once you have an override file, either your own or from another user, you can import it from the Overrides page.
