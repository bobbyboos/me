This is used for two things: <ul><li>Styling: Since page lifecycles are complicated, the short version is that we add some global CSS styles to hide uncensored images while we process them</li><li>Subliminals: If you have subliminal messages enabled, the styles and logic for them are injected into each tab</li></ul></li><li><code>notifications</code>: Only used for the update checker, to notify you when there&#39;s an update available, or for breaking changes. This is needed since Chrome only auto-updates extensions from the Chrome Web Store, not locally installed ones.</li><li><code>alarms</code>: Due to changes in the Chrome extension API, this is now the only way to reliably perform tasks on a regular basis, so Beta Protection uses them for a few &quot;utility&quot; tasks.</li></ul>',26),O=t("As always, if you're worried about what Beta Protection is doing or how it works, you can always check the full source "),V={href:"https://github.com/silveredgold/beta-protection",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},H=t("on GitHub"),L=t(".");function Z(U,Q){const o=a("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),r(l,null,[p,f,e("p",null,[g,m,b,w,y,e("a",_,[k,n(o)]),x]),v,B,C,e("p",null,[I,e("a",P,[S,n(o)]),q]),R,e("p",null,[E,e("a",D,[F,n(o)]),A,T,M,W,X]),z,e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[Y,e("a",j,[G,n(o)])])]),N,e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,[O,e("a",V,[H,n(o)]),L])])],64)}var $=h(u,[["render",Z]]);export{$ as default};
